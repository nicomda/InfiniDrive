# InfiniDrive
Unlimited Cloud Drive using Amazon Prime Photos

How it's done:
1. The app opens the file you wanna store in RAW binary
2. Bytes of the file are splitted and converted to RGB PNG images
3. Now you are ready to upload all the images to Amazon Prime Photos. As they are images, they are unlimited. You can create an album to download everything at once 
4. Download your album as a zip, then unzip it
5. The app will merge all the images to recreate the original file
6. The magic is done ðŸ˜Ž

The recovered file has perfect integrity. Sha256 checksum is passed.
